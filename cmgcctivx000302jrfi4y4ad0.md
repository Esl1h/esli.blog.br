The data format can determine team productivity and project maintainability. JSON, YAML, and TOML are the predominant formats, each with specific characteristics that make them more suitable for different contexts.

Which format should you choose when there are points to consider such as operational risk, readability, tooling, and error cost? The decision between JSON, YAML, and TOML is not religious; it is probabilistic. Which one reduces the chance of you imploding a deployment because of an extra space, an ambiguous boolean, or a missing comma? That is the criterion.

## JSON: The universal web standard

JSON has established itself as the de facto format for APIs and web applications due to native support in virtually all languages and browsers.

Advantages and limitations: JSON offers extremely fast parsing/serialization, universal support, and a compact structure ideal for data transmission and validation via JSON Schema. However, the absence of comments hinders configuration, the verbose syntax with mandatory quotes generates visual noise, and the limited data types (no native date/time) can be restrictive.

JSON gets the job done. When the team tries to “humanize” JSON with JSONC or JSON5 at runtime, incidents begin. Editor is fine. Production is not.

Ideal use cases: REST APIs, API payloads, build tool configurations (package.json, tsconfig.json), NoSQL storage.

## YAML: Readability above all else

YAML prioritizes human readability through meaningful indentation and is widely adopted in DevOps and application configurations.

Advantages and limitations: YAML offers maximum human readability, native comment support, natural hierarchical structures, rich data types, and references for reuse. However, critical indentation (spaces vs. tabs) can cause errors, parsing is slower than JSON, and complex syntax with extensive specification can lead to subtle problems.

Ideal use cases: Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), Ansible playbooks.

## TOML: The practical balance

TOML balances readability and simplicity, created by the co-founder of GitHub to solve specific configuration file problems.

Advantages and limitations: TOML combines intuitive and unambiguous syntax, comment support, well-defined data types, and efficient parsing. Limitations include a smaller ecosystem compared to JSON/YAML, less flexibility for very complex structures, verbosity in object arrays, and still growing adoption.

Ideal use cases: Monorepos, CLIs, project configuration files (Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml), application configurations, development tool settings.

## Specific alternatives

There are useful and honest alternatives.

**env** does the basics quickly, ideal for parameterization by environment in the Twelve-Factor model, but does not scale in hierarchy or types;

**INI**: Still relevant for legacy applications and simple configurations on Windows. Limited in hierarchical structure.

**XML**: Remains relevant in enterprise systems, SOAP APIs, and where validation via schemas is critical.

**HCL** (HashiCorp Configuration Language): Specific to Terraform and HashiCorp tools. Combines readability with expressiveness for infrastructure as code.

**RON** (Rusty Object Notation): Emerging in the Rust ecosystem, it offers richer data types than JSON.

**MessagePack/BSON**: Binary formats for cases where transmission performance is critical.

## Which one?

The important question: when should each be used?

APIs and contracts between services require JSON, validated by schema. This combination makes integration cheaper and prevents payloads outside the contract.

Infrastructure and pipelines that humans touch daily require YAML, as long as you impose discipline: YAML 1.2, no tabs, linters, schema validation, and dry-run in pipeline.

Application configuration requires TOML when the team wants to maintain context in the file, have real dates/times, and have an explicit hierarchy. Can you live with YAML in this place? Yes. But the cognitive cost of indentation appears over time. Can you force JSON? Yes, you can, but you will lose comments or start inventing workarounds that break portability.

## Architectural decisions

For APIs and communication between systems: JSON remains the obvious choice. Performance, ubiquity, and consolidated tooling outweigh any limitations.

For configuration files: TOML offers the best cost-benefit ratio between readability and simplicity. YAML when hierarchical complexity justifies the additional learning curve.

For CI/CD and orchestration: YAML dominates this space, but be careful with indentation. Lint and validation tools are mandatory.

For development configurations: TOML is gaining traction (especially in modern languages), but JSON still has better editor support.

### Production considerations

**Performance**: JSON &gt; TOML &gt; YAML for parsing/serialization.

**Maintainability**: TOML &gt; YAML &gt; JSON for complex configurations.

**Tooling**: JSON &gt; YAML &gt; TOML in terms of editors, linters, and validators.

**Learning curve**: JSON &gt; TOML &gt; YAML for new developers.

## Incidents have patterns

YAML often breaks due to ambiguity and invisible whitespace. Mitigation is boring: lock in a version (1.2.2 is the current one), lint everything, validate with schema, prohibit tabs, run dry-run (kubectl apply --dry-run, ansible --check), and educate the team about booleans and disambiguated strings.

JSON breaks due to lack of comments: the answer is contract and documentation generated from the schema, embedded descriptions, and versioned examples.

TOML breaks due to parser differences and new features: fix versions, have round-trip tests and a verifier in CI.

In all cases, do not store secrets in pure configuration files. Use SOPS with age/GPG, a KMS, a Vault. Block secrets in PR with gitleaks or trufflehog.

Automatically format and fail fast in the pipeline: yamllint, kubeconform/kubeval, Spectral for schemas, Ajv for JSON, Taplo for TOML.

Pre-commit is your life insurance.

## Conclusion

As I emphasized above, there is no “silver bullet.” Nor is there a correct one to use.

The decision must consider the team's context, project complexity, and available tools.

The important thing is consistency: once the standard is defined, stick to it throughout the project. Changing formats in the middle of development creates more problems than benefits.

I currently use JSON for APIs, TOML for app configurations, and YAML only when forced by tools (K8s, Docker Compose). TOML's readability has compensated for its lower market adoption in most of my projects.

Standardize what you can. Automate what is standardized. Always validate. The choice of format is not about identity; it is operational. The best is the one that reduces MTTR and does not wake you up at three in the morning.

Fun fact: Only the YAML website is a yaml :-)

Fun fact 2: In Bash/Shell script, you will use/install the utilities to work with each one: yq (yaml), jq (json), and stoml (toml). But you can parse in bash using sed and awk:

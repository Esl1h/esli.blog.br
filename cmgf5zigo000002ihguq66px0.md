## My thoughts on my setup:

I downloaded Wavelet on Android, but due to HiByMusic and USB Pro connect to Qobuz and have your own eq, I'm exploring the first two quite a bit before combine with any other softwares (in Wavelet case, Qobuz app + Wavelet).

The Behringer products I have are terrible. It was a waste of money, and I would be embarrassed to resell them to anyone. But I think I must have been misled by the store selling something used/refurbished (in the case of the pedal) and had plenty of headaches with UCG102 configurations on Linux in the past.

Galaxy Buds Pro are excellent, but only for listening to music on a smartphone. I sometimes use them on Linux, but I feel they heat up more than normal.

Edifier W820NB Plus is my everyday headphones... work, meetings, perfect on Windows and Linux, but in the future I won’t buy anything Bluetooth, only devices with a 2.4 GHz wireless option.

Mini amplifiers are good, but very limited. I knew that when I bought them and I'm fine with them, but I need a standard amplifier for the bass (in fact, something my wife asked for when she noticed the difference when I play on other models).

Pedals from the Brazilian manufacturer TMiranda are superior to those from Fender, BOSS, and others I've used. Their amplifiers are on my wish list.

My first bass was a Memphis Tagima Jazz Bass in sunburst. I've had it since 2005, and it's still my favourite.

And my biggest frustration: not being able to set up a complete and functional workstation as a Home Studio using 100% Linux. I tried for a long time, using Ubuntu Studio (because it comes ready to use out-of-the-box)... I used it a lot to record and edit videos (mainly OBS and Kdenlive), but I was never able to fully capture and record the bass with totally satisfaction (for me).

These equipments were bought a long time ago (except SSL2+), so I need to update this environment: closed-back headphones for recording, and a condenser microphone.

I will set up my new home studio in 1 or 2 years (when I move to new and better space, I hope) and I can increase the acoustic ambient and investing better on this.

To use SSL2+ on Linux, I am testing several apps, but lately, I have been using REAPER more (and testing/trying the Mixbus 11 - whose licence came bundled with SSL2+ and also has a Linux version). Due to the installation and trial period... it will end around Black Friday, so I may purchase it or focus on a FOSS alternative. I will write about DAW in Linux, this options and another, soon.

The PC/Workstation and Laptop, both are using Fedora 42 (KDE).  
PC is connected to SSL2+ (USB-C) but is connected too directly to Edifier S360DB with Toslink (Optical cable interface)

Since the pandemic, I haven't played at all. I've been playing and studying bass since 2005, and I've played in a few bands, but I've completely neglected it over the last 5 years... The idea of a new house, a space for a home studio, has given me back my enthusiasm. :-)

I really hope to update this post in the near future, and if that happens, I'll be immensely happy.

Meanwhile...

I wrote about transforming an old smartphone in a dedicated Digital Audio Music Player (DAP) using some apps, alternative android launcher, shell script to remove android apps over adb command and my iFi Go Link (usb-c amplifier and DAC - Digital Audio Converter):

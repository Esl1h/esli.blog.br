In the megacorporation, where every access is a measured dose of digital poison, red cages hold every lock with perfectly justified reasoning. I spent two months dismantling a forgotten flaw buried deep in a rotting subsystem.

The result?

A gray meeting, full of automatic nods and procedural smiles.

Did they understand the problem? Maybe.  
Will they solve it? I doubt it.  
Most likely, another chain of bureaucracy will be born — zombie tickets, unread reports, records destined for binary oblivion.

And the client? Nothing but a decorative piece. Mentioned in speeches, discarded in practice.

The siren screams: next agenda, next theater, next cycle of chaos gift‑wrapped and sold as order.

I wake to a call: crisis room. One of the subsystems is burning.

The developers, in their blind rush, had thrown changes directly into the great central computer — the artificial mind of the megacorporation.

The first errors? Ignored, of course. Because fear of punishment is routine here; it’s safer to stay silent than admit bad code. Twenty‑four hours later, everyone pretends surprise:

“The bug appeared out of nowhere.”

We don’t correct it — no.  
We hunt for excuses.

The goal is not fixing the problem. The goal is shielding directors, protecting dashboards, avoiding the red graphs that feed their egos.

And if the client dares to complain? Easy: blame them. Blame the market, blame the war, blame the cloudy skies suffocating the corporate towers. It’s never our fault. It never will be.

And in this particular case, they decided: the client was guilty.  
Expelled. Access revoked.  
Cast into nonexistence

The maximum punishment within the corp’s system, which to the government’s eyes is nothing unusual — just the default destiny for any citizen exhibiting anomalous behavior.

## Introduction

In the megacorp, nobody is someone.  
Only pieces — stacked like rusted bolts in a machine that never stops turning.

With every terminal click, with every gray meeting, the system chews more than just people: it chews identities, it chews memories, it chews every last shred of will.

The systems engineer who wanders these digital corridors is invisible; he has no name, no power, no history. What remains is only the echo of endless work — work that never finishes, work that never matters.

An observer might say he has become part of the machine itself, condemned to chase explanations the corporation has already decided must never be found.  
And yet, that same observer might notice another detail:

Something in him still refuses to obey.  
Something in him still fights against the programmed order of chaos.

## Me

They call me a systems engineer — but at my core, I’m only a janitor of ghosts.

My routine is to sweep away traces that fade before they exist, to hunt logs that evaporate in the recycled air of the datacenter.

The corporation doesn’t want me to know.  
I cannot know where the data comes from, why it exists, or who it serves.  
Everything is shielded. Everything is compartmentalized. Everything is filtered.

All I see are the rotten scraps: error 500s spat out like garbage, exceptions that no hand will claim, integrations half‑welded between systems that refuse to speak.

I am paid to put out fires with a bucket filled with holes — and I must never, ever ask where the fire began.

What I do know is simple: I am replaceable.

Just another face in the battalion of shadows.

If tomorrow I vanish, someone else will slide into the same chair, will open the same useless tickets, will be ignored in the same purposeless meetings.

But while I still breathe in this digital basement, I keep looking.  
I keep watching.  
I keep trying to see what I should never see.

## **CASE Nº 000‑1753‑X CRN‑Ω**

Today was another day when the megacorp invented a crisis just to justify its own paralysis.

The alert pierced my skull like a siren:

“Subsystem unavailable. Possible critical failure.”

I already knew the ritual to come.

Here, the word ‘critical’ has lost all meaning. It’s nothing more than a pretext to summon ten teams into a crisis room where no one wants ownership, no one wants guilt.

I dragged myself to the chair. The terminal came alive, glowing in front of me like the bars of a cell. The connection opened. Twelve windows flickered in videoconference.

Half the cameras off.

The other half showed pale faces, bored faces, each glance drifting toward other screens.

Some chewed synthetic coffee.

Others had the frozen expression of people who have already surrendered, already accepted themselves as part of the machine.

The incident?

A persistent 500 error in the authentication service.

Nothing new.

Nothing critical.

Just another symptom, banal and dull, as common as the metallic dust floating in the recycled datacenter air.

But within minutes the dance began:

— Not my module.

— Must be the network.

— Could be the database.

— Or maybe the user doesn’t know how to log in.

The theater never changes.

The bureaucratic tragedy repeats itself, always with different actors, always with the same script.

While they kept performing, I pulled the logs.

The manuals promise ten days of history.

A lie.

I barely captured five minutes before everything evaporated — swallowed by the corp’s black hole.

Here, logging is programmed to die before it’s even born.

No trail survives.

And without logs, there is no proof.

And without proof, there is no incident.

Unfounded.

That’s the magic stamp. That’s the sacred word.

The one that turns real failures into disposable myths.

Still, I pressed forward:

“There are exceptions firing. Can anyone confirm if the app is writing to the collector?”

Silence.

Long. Heavy.

The silence that says: we know, but we will not admit it.

Finally, a mechanized voice replied, flat as protocol:

“If there are no logs, there is no error.”

And that was it. Case closed.

But I had seen it.

I had captured it in that split second before the erasure.

Requests cut short. Payloads corrupted. Incoherent responses.

The authentication service had not merely crashed.

It had bled across boundaries.

User data colliding. Clients overlapping.

One person, trying to enter with the key to their bank account, was handed shards of someone else’s profile — name broken, address scrambled, even fragments of credit card details flashing where they did not belong.

And this was not the first time.

The flaw returned, always in waves.

But no one — no one — would admit it.

The room stayed in ritual.

The operations manager, smiling with the practiced grin of flesh wrapped around procedure, finally announced:

“Best not to open a card for this. If we open a card, SLA time starts counting.”

Approval rippled through the windows — automatic nods, dead expressions, the chorus of obedience.

No card, no problem.

No record, no responsibility.

I killed my microphone.

Let them speak in circles.

I opened another terminal.

And I began digging where I shouldn’t.

Because I know the corp hates the curious.

But I also know the corp does not monitor as closely as it pretends.

There is no real monitoring here.

Only dashboards.

Colorful dashboards, fabricated for propaganda.

Dashboards designed for directors, displaying perfect uptime, trivial latencies, immaculate availability.

All of it false. Numbers of lies. Scripts wrapping rot.

So I began with the clients.

What I found was a joke. A cruel one.

Client records fractured beyond repair. Mandatory fields left blank. Duplicated documents. Absurd addresses.

One client registered in São Paulo. The same ID attached to another record in New York. Another in New Delhi. Another — floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

None of it matched.

All of it broken.

The system was a mosaic of contradictions.

And worse — I realized the data was never built for the clients. Never. Not once.

The data exists only as fuel.

Fuel for something else.

Something hidden.

Clients are not the product.

Clients are disposable.

The system was never built for them.

I kept tracing.

I reached silos.

Each team locked in its own quadrant.

Each application fenced off by red walls.

I asked who owned components.

“Maybe Team X.”

“No, I think Team Y.”

“Could be Sigma. Could be Delta.”

Hours wasted — not in repairing, but in chasing phantoms of responsibility.

The truth is raw: nothing here has an owner.

The system is an orphanage of code.

At dusk, the incident still existed — but only in the invisible layer where real clients suffered.

In the official record? It was already dead.

Closed as Unfounded.

Buried without trace.

That night I couldn’t disconnect.

I kept staring at the datacenter walls as if staring at a corpse.

The fans blew recycled metallic dust across the floor. The servers vibrated like rust‑eaten hearts, beating packets for no one, to nowhere.

And that was when the question came:

Who owns this? Who takes care of it?

The answers led me in circles.

The authentication service … it should have had an owner.

But the repositories said one thing.

The internal directories said another.

The “updated” documents were fossils — 2017 fossils.

I asked colleagues:

“That belongs to Orion.”

“No, Orion was dismantled.”

“Then Sigma’s problem.”

“I thought it was Delta.”

Always the same game — a corpse tossed from one hand to another, each person denying the body.

Not my module.

Not my system.

Not my death.

Digging deeper, I unearthed tickets tied to owners already gone from the corp.

Monitoring runs aimed at systems long deactivated.

Critical services spinning for years without anyone claiming them.

Orphaned processes still running, yet feeding into secret integrations.

Hidden pipelines still sucking their data into flows no one dared map.

That was when I saw it, again.  
The sigil.

Buried in configs that no one had touched for years.

A field, a target: CRN‑Ω.

## **CRN‑Ω AND THE AFTERMATH**

I kept digging, even knowing that every line I pulled was a thread from a fabric never meant to be unraveled.

CRN‑Ω was not just another obscure replication target.

It was a sinkhole.

Everything funneled there was shredded, repackaged, rewritten. Clients’ data, internal records, transaction trails, logs meant to prove history — all of it drawn away into an opaque mass outside the cluster.

No IP.

No host.

No name in any directory.

Just hunger. A void, eating bits.

That was when it became clear: the corporation does not have systems.

The corporation is the system.

And like every living thing, it has an organ reserved for excretion.

CRN‑Ω.

The blind intestine of the megacorp. The hidden sink where it digests what must never be seen.

Errors do not vanish because they are fixed.

They vanish because the system consumes them.

Glitches don’t die. They are metabolized.

Assimilated and dissolved until proof itself is erased.

A ritual cleansing.

A programmed sacrifice.

So the dashboards may shine in perfect stability.

The next day, without warning, a deposit appeared in my corporate account.

A fat bonus.

Glistening numbers. Too heavy, too generous, too sharp.

At its side, an email:

“We thank you for your exemplary professionalism.”

And I knew.

Nothing is more of a threat than a thank‑you that arrives at the wrong time.

With that money, I could have bought a new glass apartment, towers of white and chrome, overlooking holographic billboards selling happiness.

I could have bought a self‑driving armored car, immune to the very violence the corp itself breeds.

I could have sunk into the neon darkness of the licensed pleasure districts, where synthetic flesh rents sterile ecstasy by the hour.

But no.

I took the bonus straight to the hidden market.

A cube of neon, disguised between derelict storefronts. A cubicle where corporate credits could still be laundered into digital currency, encrypted and untraceable.

A crack in the network. A place without cameras.

I exchanged every digit and left with nothing but anonymized zeroes and ones — currency stripped of the corporation's gaze.

When I stepped out, acid rain fell as always, dissolving the false polish from the skyline.

The towers rose like tombstones, their windows blind eyes staring into nothing.

The datacenter fans howled behind me, expelling recycled metallic breath, as if rusted hearts were still pumping packets into the void.

I remembered Neuromancer.

I remembered Blade Runner.

Always these ghosts.

Always these déjà‑vus, as if I were nothing but a minor NPC trapped in a scratched VHS of someone else’s future.

Gibson had already written these halls before I was alive

Scott had already filmed this rain before it fell on my skin.

For a fleeting moment, I wondered if I wasn’t just another glitch pretending to be a protagonist.

A shadow wandering someone else’s script.

A secondary character in a story that has no end credits.  
And then I laughed.

A laugh alone, cut short.

Nostalgia — it’s the cheapest drug the corp ever sold us.

The most paralyzing.

The filler for souls too weak to face their real prisons.

And the real world? The real world is heavy enough already, without reenacting old fictions.

So I turned off the terminal.

And the system kept moving.

It kept chewing identities.

It kept erasing logs.

It kept manufacturing ghosts.

Tomorrow the sirens will wail again.

Tomorrow the gray meetings will gather on schedule.

Tomorrow the zombie tickets will march across the board.

Tomorrow I will still be here, breathing the same metallic air, typing the same endless commands, pretending I’m in control of something.

But tonight — just tonight — I cut through the loop.

Tonight I still see the ghosts the corp manufactures.

And in this world, seeing the ghosts is almost rebellion.

## Why You Should Avoid AI in Every App

AI is being embedded everywhere — apps, systems, websites.  
But you don’t need to accept it blindly. Avoid logging in, avoid giving away your data.  
Whenever possible, use AI tools through **Tor** or with maximum anonymity.

I had posted this list as a simple note on my listed.to address (over StandardNotes) but decided to bring it here ;-)

## Free AI Chatbots Accessible via Tor (No Login Required)

Please note that some of these may have limitations on use due to the absence of user login.

Obviously, there will be no history, so if you think it prudent, store your prompt and the results of the interactions somewhere safe.

## Best Self-Hosted AI Alternatives (Private & Local)

### Recommended: Kobold.cpp

[https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)  
Download models at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and run them locally.  
No logins, no spying, no hidden data harvesting.

Best option (and the only self-hosted one I've tested on my simple home-server)

## The Changing AI Landscape: Free to Paid, Open to Closed

Big Tech launched free AI tools to crush competition and capture users.  
Now the cycle is shifting:

* Prices are rising.
    
* Fewer players dominate the market.
    
* Monetization of user data is inevitable.
    

Remember: your data has **always** been collected.  
The real question is — **how will they use it against you?**
